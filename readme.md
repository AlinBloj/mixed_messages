# mixed messages
## a off-platform chalange from codecademy
In this code, I've defined three arrays: 
* variable1, 
* variable2, 
* variable3 
and a *** generateRandomMessage() *** function that generates a message composed of 2 or 3 random variables. 
The message is constructed by randomly combining one variable from each list. *** There's a 50% chance that the message will include a third variable. ***
